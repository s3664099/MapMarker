#Map Marker

This is the original version of the Beer and Coffee maps that I developed, however it used open maps as opposed to Google Maps, and it was also
written in javascript with some HTML. This is now obsolete considering that beer & coffee maps is now working, ane more extensive.

This file uses openlayers to mark locations on the map. These are locations that I have visited and are uploaded from a CSV file.
Each of the locations also has an icon based on what type of place the location is.
