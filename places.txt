Adelaide Airport	1 James Schofield Dr, Adelaide Airport SA 5950	Adelaide Airport	SA	Aus	(08) 8308 9211	www.adelaideairport.com.au	-34.9448256	138.5284	2	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	It's an airport, but for some reason they put a plaza in front of the terminal so you can't simply walk out and jump in a cab. Now you have drag your luggage an extra hundred metres to get anywhere.	
Melbourne Airport	Departure Dr, Melbourne Airport VIC 3045	Melbourne Airport	Vic	Aus	(03) 9297 1600	www.melbourneairport.com.au	-37.669008	144.8408905	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Not sure how to write a review about an airport since I generally don't spend all that much time here. Mind you, it's not bad, but it is fairly small, which is not surprising since it is more of an 'end of the line' airport as opposed to a major terminus.	
Perth Airport	Horrie Miller Drive, Perth Airport WA 6105	Perth Airport	WA	Aus	(08) 9478 8888	www.perthairport.com.au	-31.9385216	115.9672108	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Feels like a regional airport, though quite new. Lots of planes going off to the middle of nowhere.	
Sydney Airport	General Holmes Drive, Sydney NSW 2020	Sydney Airport	NSW	Aus	(02) 9667 9111	www.sydneyairport.com.au	-33.9411804	151.1744364	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	It's an airport. Have had to spend an inordinate amount on time wandering around here. At least they have a train underground.	
Dubbo Regional Airport	Cooreena Rd, Dubbo NSW 2830	Dubbo	NSW	Aus	(02) 6801 4560	www.dubboairport.com.au	-32.2188718	148.5696877	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	The first and only regional airport that I have visited. Actually pretty pricey to fly out here, and facilities reasonable considering the size of the place.	
Brisbane Airport	11 The Circuit, Brisbane Airport QLD 4008	Brisbane Airport	Qld	Aus	(07) 3406 3000	www.bne.com.au	-27.3942144	153.1196363	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Can’t say that it is the best, but it serves its purpose. The fact that it has a train station certainly sets it apart from other airports in Australia.	
Changi Airport	Airport Blvd, Singapore	Changi	SG	SG	+65 6595 6868	www.changiairport.com	1.3626344	103.9897176	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Not a bad place for a long layover, particularly since it is a major hub in the region. For some reason I prefer Hong Kong airport, but that probably has more to do with the city than anything else. Also, I'm not big on shopping.	
Penang International Airport	Lapangan Terbang Antarabangsa Bayan Lepas, 11900 Bayan Lepas, Penang, Malaysia	Sungai Ara	Penang	My	+60 4-252 0252	www.penangairport.com	5.2907155	100.2674117	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Smallish airport, but practical. Has pretty much everything you need. It is a major holiday resort as well.

Make sure you give yourself lots and lots of time to get to your plane. We gave ourselves two hours and made it within minutes of them starting to board.	
Luxembourg Airport	Rue de Trèves, 2632 Findel, Luxembourg	Lux	Lux	Lux	+352 24 640	www.lux-airport.lu	49.6302477	6.2095414	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Yep, it’s the airport. It’s where I went to drop off the car.	
Hong Kong International Airport	1 Sky Plaza Rd, Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong	Lantau	HK	China	+852 2181 8888	www.hongkongairport.com	22.3110428	113.9195703	5	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Amazing. Huge. The first airport I visited on my first trip out of Australia. Mind = blown.

Has a train that takes you to the city, which makes it better than Melbourne.	
Phenom Pehn International Airport	12000 Russian Federation Blvd, Phnom Penh, Cambodia	Phnom Penh	PP	Cmb	+855 23 862 800	www.pnh.cambodia-airports.aero	11.5526246	104.8449493	4	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Actually not too bad. Bookings only open a short time before flight leaves, but quite well decked out.

You do walk across the tarmac, but that's expected for a regional airport.	
Don Mueang International Airport	222 Vibhavadi Rangsit Rd, Sanambin, Don Mueang, Bangkok 10210, Thailand	Don Mueang	Bangkok	Thai	+66 2 535 1192	www.airportthai.co.th	13.9145896	100.6024587	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Managed to cut through customs and passport control. Basically the airport where all the low cost carriers come in. The old train stops here, and there is a free shuttle bus to the other airport.	
Suvarnabhumi Airport	999 Soi Mu Ban Nakhon Thong 1, Nong Prue, Bang Phli District, Samut Prakan 10540, Thailand	Lat Krabang	Bangkok	Thai	+66 2 132 1888	www.airportthai.co.th	13.7000152	100.7073283	4	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Not a bad airport. Quite large, and can take a while to get around. Smaller carriers required you to take a bus to the plane. However not bad, and plenty of shops and places to grab a drink.	
Phuket International Airport	Mai Khao, Thalang District, Phuket 83110, Thailand	Thalang	Phuket	Thai	+66 76 351 122	www.airportthai.co.th	8.1113056	98.3072032	3	Airport	aeroplane.png	Y	Has been completely revamped since last here.

Still have the pirate ship and the castle, however the maze has changed and they have closed the volcano.

Warner Bros Movie World	Pacific Mwy, Oxenford QLD 4210	Helensvale	Qld	Aus	13 33 86	www.movieworld.com.au	-27.9077165	153.31181	2	Amusement	amusement-park.png	Y	One of the first Theme Parks I visited. Not as great as it was the first time. Just rides and shows, and expensive food.

Not being a part of the scene myself I can't say all that much about this place, other than that they do have drag shows. I only found out about it quite by accident by walking in here for a beer. Didn't seem all that bad, but you really need to speak to people in the know.
